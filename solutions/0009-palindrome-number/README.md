## 📌 Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.



 


Example 1:



```text

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

Example 2:



```text

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

Example 3:



```text

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

 


**Constraints:**




	- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`


 


**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
